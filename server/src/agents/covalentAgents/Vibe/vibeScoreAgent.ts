			### **Current Question & Response:**
			**Q:** ${question}  
			**A:** ${answer}

			### **Scoring Guidelines:**
			1. **Cultural Alignment:** Does their answer show they *get* the memecoin ethos?
			2. **Authenticity & Depth:** Does it feel real, or are they just throwing buzzwords?
			3. **Chaos Factor:** Are they embracing unpredictability, or playing it too safe?
			4. **Whitepaper Fit:** Does their response match core project values?

			**Score the answer on a scale of 0-10 based on the following:**
			- **0-3:** ðŸš¨ Immediate red flagâ€”mainstream, inauthentic, or totally missing the vibe.
			- **4-6:** ðŸ¤” Passable but unremarkableâ€”shows *some* alignment but feels surface-level.
			- **7-8:** ðŸŽ¯ Solidâ€”deep-cut references, genuine engagement, and *some* chaos.
			- **9-10:** ðŸ”¥ Perfect fitâ€”unpredictable, meme-fluent, and undeniably aligned with the culture.

			### **Return a numerical response(1-10) based on vibe
